Python code for reproduce the figures of the Chapter:
====================================================
Existence, characterization, and simulation of optimal control policies for a family of epidemic models.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All examples are sorting according a its folder. Each folder encloses 
a python class for describe the control problem
named as problem.py, a derived class in the file 
forward_backward_sweep.py wiht the mentioned method, 
and a file named named problemPy.py with the implementation of bouth clases,
which gives figures files as output.
