Python code for reproduce the figures of the Chapter:
====================================================
Existence, characterization, and simulation of optimal control policies in some classical epidemic models.
All examples are sorting according a its folder. Each folder contens a python class for describe the control problem
named as problem.py, a derived class in the file forward_backward_sweep.py wiht the mentioned method, and a implementation
of bouth clases which gives figures files as output.
