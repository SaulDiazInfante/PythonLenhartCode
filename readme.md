Python code for reproduce the figures of the Chapter:
====================================================
Existence, characterization, and simulation of optimal control policies for a family of epidemic models.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All examples are sorting according to its folder. Each folder encloses a python class for describing the
control problem named as a problem.py, a derived class in the file forward_backward_sweep.py with the
mentioned method, and a file named problemPy.py with the implementation of both classes, which gives 
figures.eps files.
